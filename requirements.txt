# Vomee Multi-Modal Data Capture System Dependencies

# Core dependencies
numpy>=1.21.0
opencv-python>=4.5.0

# PyQt5 and PyQtGraph for GUI
PyQt5>=5.15.0
pyqtgraph>=0.12.0

# GPU-accelerated processing
cupy-cuda11x>=10.0.0  # Adjust cuda version as needed (cuda11x, cuda12x, etc.)

# MediaPipe for skeleton detection (optional)
mediapipe>=0.9.0

# Note: For CuPy, install the version matching your CUDA version:
# - cupy-cuda11x for CUDA 11.x
# - cupy-cuda12x for CUDA 12.x
# - cupy for automatic detection (may not work on all systems)
#
# If no NVIDIA GPU is available, the system will fail to process mmWave data.
# Consider adding a CPU fallback using numpy.fft if needed.
